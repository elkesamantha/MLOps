Article: S. Warnett and U. Zdun, "Architectural Design Decisions for the Machine Learning Workflow" in Computer, vol. 55, no. 03, pp. 40-51, 2022. Doi: 10.1109/MC.2021.3134800


The article describes a qualitative investigation of architectural decisions faced by professionals as current practices in machine learning (ML).

Ordinary ML developers are not typically trained in software engeneering (SE) and therefore are not routinely applied in engineering and architectural techniques. On the other hand, software engineers and architects typically do not work as ML and therefore regularly concern themselves with solutions for ML systems. The problems resulting from the divergence of these disciplines are further compounded by the technical challenges that often arise in ML projects that are often absent from non-ML projects, such as developing and maintaining ML solutions.
